Description: BASS is a computational method that performs transcriptomic 
    analysis at two different scales. At the single-cell scale, BASS performs 
    cell type clustering and clusters cells into multiple cell types. At the 
    tissue regional scale, BASS segments tissues into tissue structures in a 
    de novo fashion and characterizes the cell type composition in each 
    detected tissue region separately. The analyses at the two different 
    resolutions are performed in a coherent way through a Bayesian hierarchical 
    model, which allows us to seamlessly integrate gene expression information 
    with spatial information to improve analyses at both resolutions.
